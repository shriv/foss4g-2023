    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe disciplines of architecture, urban design and urban planning have long dominated the thinking around cities and urbanism. But, the world is now majority urban: just over 1 in 2 people worldwide are urban citizens. With the ongoing super-linear increase in urban citizens since the 1960s, the challenges faced by cities can no longer be supported by such a small number of professionals. Diversity of thought and approaches to identifying and managing urban challenges becomes the responsibility of everyday citizens.\nUnfortunately, the interest and curiosity of the urbanite is not matched by the availability of data and tools for analysis. Professionals have access to data and tools to enable their study of cities which are typically out of reach for non-professionals. This web-book and accompanying talk are aimed at bridging this gap with FOSS and open data."

    "text": "1.1 Approach\nUrban analysis spans a limitless spectrum from qualitative social science to quantitative methods with big data and machine learning. This web-book advocates and details a code-based quantitative approach that emphasises visual outputs and qualitative interpretation. But why code rather than a mature application like QGIS? A few reasons:\n\nThere are already plenty of QGIS tutorials. Several workshops for this year’s FOSS4G SOTM Oceania involve QGIS..!\nWhile there are many urban analytics courses that focus on machine learning (here, here and here) and courses for learning Python or R geospatial methods, there aren’t as many that focus on simple analyses and an overview of how to build more insights.\nA code-based approach to understanding urbanism is far more flexible in the long run. Powerful software like QGIS hit their limits quickly but writing your own code can make use of packages and even other programming languages if the one you have chosen is not sufficient for a particular task. The latter aspect is gaining considerable traction with tools like Rstudio, Jupyter and others allowing for dovetailed analyses between popular languages like R, Python and Julia.\nThe algorithms in QGIS are available as a command line utility that you can connect via code to your programming language choice - manually or with existing tools. So, you can do what you would have done in QGIS plus all the things you couldn’t!\nThe power of FOSS and open data lies in the extensions - from repeating analyses for different locations or greater spatial extent to statistical modelling, machine learning and big data processing. For example, generating a figure-ground diagram (Section 5.3) for a 500m\\(^{2}\\) area with code allows for easy extension to generating hundreds and thousands of the same with only a single change to the central coordinate."

A very simple rubric to choose is the preference for visualisation and statistical modelling vs. machine learning. R has a slight edge for the former and Python to latter though in my experience both languages work very well for urban analyses.\nThe typical upskilling (if you haven’t coded before) is to begin with learning basic data science coding before moving on to learning how to handle geospatial data. Given the popularity of data science as a career, excellent free resources for learning R and Python are easily found with a simple search. Some good ones to start with include:\n\nR for data science\nPython data science handbook\n\nGeospatial data science is no longer far behind with increasing awareness in the research communities of the opportunities and rich insights.

Tourists (from the city or elsewhere) visit these areas for specific experiences or vibe - for example, a theatre and dining experience in the thespian cluster at the West End of London.\nIn a city like Wellington, POIs are tightly clustered in the city centre and across a select few “high streets” of higher density suburbs like Newtown, Miramar, Karori and Johnsonville that act like satellite hubs. Unlike the frothing, spicy, tumultuous flavours of Mumbai, the flavour of Wellington is more of a simmering broth with a strong depth of flavour from the tightly clustered, amenity-rich city centre and sudden, deep bursts of flavour as we explore the surrounding suburbs."

All the OSM attributes associated with cafes can be accessed by hovering and clicking on a given cafe location. Note, almost all of attributes are generally not filled in.\n\n\n\nSome countries and cities manage their own POI datasets. For example, the UK sells a POI dataset updated multiple times a year while France maintains an open POI database that is updated annually. New Zealand doesn’t have an official source of POI data, OSM can be reasonably accurate for longer standing businesses or regularly updated by dedicated maintainers in some areas (perhaps this could be you!).\nThe biggest challenge for POI information is in developing countries where the Google Places API is the only possible data source. Unfortunately, Google Places API restricts results (max of 60 as at 2023) and starts charging after a certain number of queries. It’s possible that Fourquare API is better but realistically neither APIs will capture the street vendors or smaller food joints that have opened only recently. The dynamism and vitality of developing country cities will not be reflected in the datasets currently available."

Modes that share the public street space (all but trains) can be considered together or separately depending on the analysis.\nThe mobility fingerprint of a city is the way street space is shared across the transport modes [1]. Cities like Portland and Copenhagen have streets that are pedestrian-only as well as streets that are split for pedestrians and cars (the typical configuration of road and footpath). Amsterdam, with its notable cycling culture has many streets / paths dedicated for cyclists only.

We regularly route our proposed journeys with apps like Google Maps to understand transport options and travel distances and times.

This hybrid of the physical and digital is so entrenched that we barely give it a second thought.\nThe same routing algorithms run by Google (and others) can be reproduced with FOSS and open data. Instead of using a single route for journey planning or navigation, we instead use it for analysis. The simplest routing-based analysis is calculating isochrones.\n\n\n\nWalking isocrhones in 5 minute increments to 25 minutes.

They are a simple visualisation focused on a central location - usually a point of interest e.g. a railway station. Routes are calculated as shortest paths from every intersection in the surrounding street network to this point.

This is even more the case for urban areas with a large number of informal dwellings (independent or as part of a slum cluster). Within slums, buildings dictate movement more than street networks via narrow alleys (“gullies” in Mumbai parlance) rather than formally managed and designed streets.\nDespite a substantial slum population (last calculated ~42% in 2011 [2]), the ingenuity of the people living in these areas exceeds imagination. Facilitated by the cheek-by-jowl proximity of labour and business, slums are economic powerhouses where no task is too small. For example, the recycling of hair waste to wigs and hair extensions is a multi-million dollar industry that employs a vast segment of entrepreneurial individuals and businesses from ragpickers (collecting discarded hair from the streets) to local waste collection depots and wig artisans [3].\n\nIf you look over the sprawl extending out from Indian cities, you will see that there are a lot of informal developments that are not slums. The more affluent of these settlements differ in terms of their density and the materials from which they are built, and they tend to be made up of single family homes with private space. Yet the form of the settlement, the layout of streets and spaces, and the relationship of homes to each other is not so different from the poorest settlements made out of corrugated sheet and tarpaulin.\n\n\nRudlin and Hemani.

However, the diagram can be adjusted by adding green space, water bodies and streets with a tentative width corresponding to its hierarchy for more insights about the urban tissue.\n\nBy showing buildings in black and removing most other detail, they [the figure-ground] reveal the truth about a place. Like X-rays, they are calibrated to see through the tissue of detail on a map or aerial photo, revealing the underlying structure of an urban area. In doing so, the plans reveal the shattering and decay of many industrial towns and cities as well as the inner beauty and structure of ‘healthy’ urban places. You can look at the figure ground plan of a city and ‘read’ the place: you can generally tell where the centre is and trace the transept to its suburbs, you can follow the line of the most important commercial streets, identify which districts are thriving and which are declining.\n\n\nRudlin and Hemani.
