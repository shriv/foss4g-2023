    "text": "2.1 POIs flavour the city\nIn larger cities POIs, describe the flavour of a neighbourhood through their character and distribution. Tourists (from the city or elsewhere) visit these areas for specific experiences or vibe - for example, a theatre and dining experience in the thespian cluster at the West End of London.\nIn a city like Wellington, POIs are tightly clustered in the city centre and across a select few “high streets” of higher density suburbs like Newtown, Miramar, Karori and Johnsonville that act like satellite hubs. Unlike the frothing, spicy, tumultuous flavours of Mumbai, the flavour of Wellington is more of a simmering broth with a strong depth of flavour from the tightly clustered, amenity-rich city centre and sudden, deep bursts of flavour as we explore the surrounding suburbs."

    "text": "2.2 Exploring POIs\nDepending on the city of interest, POI data may be plentiful, scarce or patchy. For many countries and cities, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a query-able data repository of POI information. For example, a simple query below to get cafes in Wellington, NZ.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(osmdata)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# get point location data of cafes\nwgtn_cafes &lt;- opq(bbox = 'wellington city') |&gt; \n    add_osm_feature(key = 'amenity', value = 'cafe') |&gt; \n  osmdata_sf()\n\nwgtn_cafes &lt;- wgtn_cafes$osm_points\n\n\n# load plotting library\nlibrary(tmap)\n\n# plot cafe locations on interactive map\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\ntm_shape(wgtn_cafes) + \n  tm_dots()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Interactive map of cafes in Wellington. All the OSM attributes associated with cafes can be accessed by hovering and clicking on a given cafe location. Note, almost all of attributes are generally not filled in.\n\n\n\nSome countries and cities manage their own POI datasets. For example, the UK sells a POI dataset updated multiple times a year while France maintains an open POI database that is updated annually. New Zealand doesn’t have an official source of POI data, OSM can be reasonably accurate for longer standing businesses or regularly updated by dedicated maintainers in some areas (perhaps this could be you!).\nThe biggest challenge for POI information is in developing countries where the Google Places API is the only possible data source. Unfortunately, Google Places API restricts results (max of 60 as at 2023) and starts charging after a certain number of queries. It’s possible that Fourquare API is better but realistically neither APIs will capture the street vendors or smaller food joints that have opened only recently. The dynamism and vitality of developing country cities will not be reflected in the datasets currently available."

    "text": "2.3 Understanding cities with POIs\nDaily life amenities like schools, cafes, supermarkets, medical centres play a strong role in our perceptions of neighbourhoods to live in. While individuals have their own rubrics for choosing between myriad aspects of a neighbourhood amenity access, job opportunities, transport access and house prices, there are strong correlations between all these aspects that can drive general trends in cities. For example, a recent study by Zhang and Pfoser [3] found that just the density of cafes has a strong correlation with house prices.\n\n\n\nStrong correlation between coffee shop density and real estate prices in New York City. Pick your mortgage debt based on your coffee addiction! [3]\n\n\nAnother example from Luo et al. [4] shows how a collection of POIs in a city can be summarised to describe areas by functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOIs in Nanning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassifying urban areas based on POIs."

POIs are points, the easiest type of spatial data to work with, so they are a great starting place for your journey in urban data science. My own journey began with POIs for some potential client work on value derived from the placement of fuel stations in Wellington.\nPackages like osmdata in R or pyrosm in Python are great places to start. Note, if you want to download a LOT of POIs in R then getting a bulk download of all OSM data for your city with osmextract might be an easier way to go."

A helper function is used to simplify the generation of a bounding box around a central point.

For larger scale analyses, LINZ has building outlines available to download for the whole country or for a cropped section.\n\n# load packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# get buildings from LINZ export\n# https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/101290-nz-building-outlines/\nakl_bldgs &lt;- st_read(\"../extdata/lds-nz-building-outlines-SHP/\")\n\n\n# load plotting library\nlibrary(tmap)\n\n# plot buildings around Auckland Harbour\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntm_shape(akl_bldgs) + \n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Static map of buildings around Auckland Harbour.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding data quality and availability is an issue for analyses of developing nations - where the lower resources and capacity of local municipalities cannot keep up with the pace of informal development. Building shapes derived from satellite imagery help to address this issue (somewhat). Both Google and Microsoft provide global coverage of building footprints. The projects are in their nascence but it’s likely that they will only get better over time.\n The highest quality building available currently is the EUCUCCO dataset [4]. This dataset allows for detaileed analysis of urban form as it includes attributes like building type (use), height and date of construction.\n\n\n\nSome of the building attributes available in EUBUCCO. Example of Paris reproduced from [4]."

Only buildings are included in the conventional version resulting in a stark mosaic of black and white that allows for a bird’s eye analysis of urban form and structures. However, adding streets with a tentative width corresponding to its classification (decreasing width in order: primary, secondary, tertiary, residential), can offer more insights about the urban tissue.\nSquare mile comparisons of different urban areas (or the same area across time) feature extensively in the book Great Streets by Allan Jacobs [5] according to [6]. Given the highly heterogeneous urban mosaic of megacities like Mumbai, smaller areas are more meaningful as they represent a consistently designed space. For this reason, the figure-ground diagrams in Figure 4.3 have a 500m bounding box around a central coordinate.\nThe famous rectangular blocks of New York City (NYC) are a stark contrast to the more sinuous blocks of British (local and colonial) urbanism. Secondary or tertiary roads surround all blocks in NYC while blocks in Islington and Dadar Parsi Colony, two residential neighbourhoods of British design, are connected by residential roads with arterial connections much further away.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Modified figure-ground diagrams (with street widths) for neighbourhoods in Mumbai, London and New York City."
